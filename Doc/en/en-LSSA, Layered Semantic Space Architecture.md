 These notes describe a new representation of information in vector space that overcomes the limitations of standard multidimensional vectors by organizing semantic units into separate layers based on clearly distinct thematic affinities.

The objective is twofold:
- To make the spatial location of information easily identifiable, so that it can be modified.
- Consequently, to overcome the need for a static and immutable representation unless a complete reconstruction is required.
- To resolve semantic ambiguities through the logical development of cognitive pathways.
- To drastically reduce the computational cost of both creation and inference.
- To the extent that inference itself can trigger local restructuring of the representation.

The last point is crucial and represents the primary motivation behind this research: to move context from external memory into the representational structure itself, making it an integral part of its evolutionary process.

---

Imagine multiple Cartesian planes stacked along the z-axis: each plane represents a defined space of semantic affinity. Each point on the plane will host a single token, associated with a specific semantic unit (e.g., "God" could be represented by token 0). The fundamental difference from the traditional method lies in the fact that each cell of the plane represents a precise point from which outgoing semantic vectors can originate, directed toward other semantic units or even further layers.

For example, one plane might group all concepts related to music production (instruments, sheet music, tuning forks, metronomes), while another might contain all living forms (felines, canines, humans, trees, chili peppers, etc.).

A database (or tree-like data structure) will keep track of all existing semantic units, indicating for each token its belonging layer and exact coordinates. Thus, every concept will have a unique position within the structure.

Assuming, for instance, that each plane has dimensions of 500x500 (although size may vary between different layers), we would obtain up to 250,000 distinct tokens per plane. It should be noted that this measure is purely hypothetical; in reality, it's certain that the required sizes will be significantly smaller. If the expected maximum number of possible tokens is around 7,000,000 and we expect approximately 300 semantic affinity planes — considering also the mechanism for deleting unused tokens (which we will discuss later) — it is very unlikely that even the largest layer will require such dimensions.

Initially, this data structure is empty. A classifier, trained on an entire encyclopedia, will be responsible for placing each concept into its corresponding semantic affinity space, creating it if necessary, and inserting it into the database with the assigned token and coordinates.

At the end of the classifier’s work, the two data structures (Cartesian planes and database) will contain all the semantic units extracted from the encyclopedia, distributed across layers according to semantic affinity. We can call this first phase "primary training": the result will be a static representation of knowledge.

---

**The Classifier:**

At first glance, the task of the classifier may seem daunting, but in reality it is not.

The role of the classifier is not to physically insert the token into the data structures, but simply to determine its correct semantic affinity layer.  
For example, it must understand that the term "il" (the) should be placed in the layer hosting grammatical structures, while "gatto" (cat) belongs in the layer for living beings (perhaps separated between animal and plant kingdoms), and so on.  
Once this is done, a standard algorithmic solution will handle the actual placement within the data structures, with the classifier indicating the correct semantic affinity layer and whether a new one needs to be created if it doesn't already exist.

Of course, the classifier will not be a simple algorithm, but rather a model of considerable size, capable of understanding the semantic layers to which each token belongs.  
Objectively, this operation will be slow and relatively expensive — but nothing compared to the cost of building a traditional structure.  
Moreover, unlike in the past, there will never be a need for a complete restructuring.  
It's not important that the chosen placements gain general approval (which they could never achieve anyway); what matters is the semantic coherence from the perspective of that particular classifier, as this will enable consistent cognitive trajectories.

**On the Role of the Classifier: A Simple Use of Existing Models**

In our model, the classifier is neither a system to be designed nor trained from scratch. It is simply an existing language model — such as GPT, Gemini, or equivalent — used via API.

No fine-tuning or specific training is required: the model is given a brief contextual summary of the tasks to perform (e.g., *"If you read 'gatto', place it among animals," "if you read 'pesca,' create different tokens for the sport and the fruit"*), along with one encyclopedia page at a time to process and the list of already existing semantic layers.

The classifier’s task does not require complex reasoning or deep understanding: general linguistic competence is sufficient to determine which semantic layer a concept belongs to. In other words, we need a literate mind — not a genius.

This approach completely avoids the costs, complexity, and time associated with training. All it takes is a good, pre-existing model… and a simple contextual instruction.

Note: Since a reliable pre-trained model will be used, this minimizes the risks of arbitrary placement.

---

**Multiple Meanings:**

Since semantic units are derived from the reading of texts, it is likely that identical terms may represent different meanings.

In traditional representations, this is a problem — but not in ours. Different meanings correspond to different tokens, which can, if necessary, be placed in different semantic affinity layers.

**Old concepts disappear, new ones emerge**

Unlike more common representations, this organizational model allows the spatial location of each semantic unit to be identified immediately. As a result, it is inexpensive to remove old tokens that are no longer used and to add new ones — either by filling empty spaces within existing semantic affinity layers or by introducing entirely new layers.

An example could be Deep Learning itself, or earlier, automatic computation — concepts that required the introduction of entire new semantic layers.

Likewise, nothing prevents the repositioning of a token whose meaning has changed over time — something impossible in classical representations.

--- 

**Internal Memory of Semantic Nodes: Dynamic Cognitive Annotations**

Within the vector space, each token serves not only as a semantic node and origin of cognitive vectors, but can optionally host an internal memory.  
This memory is not preallocated, but represented by a simple pointer: if it is not used, it does not occupy any space.

The mind, through a specific interface, can send requests such as:

> “Write ‘consumed’ in the node corresponding to ‘peach’ in the ‘fruit’ layer.” (or "read the content")

Upon receiving such a request, the algorithm performs the following steps:

1. Identification of the node (token + layer)  
2. Check whether a memory has already been allocated  
3. Allocation, reading, or modification of the memory, as requested  

Most tokens will not require additional memory, making resource usage extremely efficient. However, for those concepts that the mind deems significant — or wishes to temporarily annotate — it will be possible to store customized information.

This internal memory is not visible externally, does not interfere with inference, and does not alter the network of cognitive vectors. It represents a form of cognitive introspection, where the mind can record states, notes, tags, flags, or contextual information useful to itself.

In essence: each concept can become, at the mind’s discretion, a small active semantic container.

---

**From Static to Dynamic Structure**

To enable this transition, we remove the classifier and introduce a simple algorithm for generating semantic vectors between existing units.

Each vector will have:

- a starting point (coordinates on the Cartesian plane),  
- an endpoint (coordinates on the same plane or a different one),  
- an associated numerical weight, which increases every time the same vector is used,  
- a "timestamp" marker, useful for identifying outdated cognitive paths and tokens no longer in use — and therefore candidates for deletion.

A "garbage collection" algorithm is scheduled to run at long temporal intervals, specifically designed to eliminate unused data.  
Unlike more traditional representation models, the presence of obsolete tokens and vectors has little impact on the computational cost of inference — aside from a slight increase in database lookup time — but it can affect space occupation within the layers, which, although large, are not infinite.

Consequently, if all vectors connected to a token are no longer used, the token itself loses its purpose and can be removed.  
If it reappears later, the inference process will recreate it exactly as words and concepts are reintroduced in natural languages.

---

**Vector Creation**

The vector creation algorithm, which is fully algorithmic, will take as input various texts — books, dialogues, movies, or any user interaction — and generate the necessary vectors to represent them.

**Practical Example:**

**Text 1:**  
*"Il gatto beve latte da una ciotola."*  
("The cat drinks milk from a bowl.")

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. A vector is created from a conventional origin point to the "living beings" semantic affinity layer, ending at the coordinates of the token *"gatto"* (cat).  
2. A new vector is created from the point *"gatto"* (cat) to the *"actions"* (actions) layer, ending at the token *"bere"* (drink).  
3. A new vector is created from *"bere"* (drink) to the *"alimenti"* (foods) layer, ending at the token *"latte"* (milk).  
4. A new vector is created from *"latte"* (milk) to the *"numeri"* (numbers) layer, ending at the token *"una"* (a/an).  
5. A new vector is created from *"una"* (a/an) to the *"strumenti da cucina"* (kitchen tools) layer, ending at the token *"ciotola"* (bowl).

These vectors are created *ex novo*, as they did not previously exist.

---

**Text 2:**  
*"Il cane beve dalla ciotola."*  
("The dog drinks from the bowl.")

The algorithm operates as follows:

1. A vector is created from the origin to the *"esseri viventi"* (living beings) layer, ending at the token *"cane"* (dog).  
2. A new vector is created from *"cane"* (dog) to the *"azioni"* (actions) layer, ending at the token *"bere"* (drink).  
3. A new vector is created from *"bere"* (drink) to the token *"dalla"* (from the).  
4. A new vector is created from *"dalla"* (from the) to the token *"ciotola"* (bowl).

Again, each vector is created *ex novo*, since these specific sequences (*"cane"* and *"dalla"*) have not yet been mapped.

---

**Text 3:**  
*"Il canarino beve dalla ciotola."*  
("The canary drinks from the bowl.")

In this case:

1. A vector is created from the origin to the *"esseri viventi"* (living beings) layer, ending at the token *"canarino"* (canary).  
2. A new vector is created from *"canarino"* (canary) to the token *"dalla"* (from the).

At this point, the algorithm recognizes that the following vectors:

- From *"dalla"* (from the) to *"bere"* (drink)  
- From *"bere"* (drink) to *"ciotola"* (bowl)

already exist within the data structure.

Therefore, instead of creating new vectors, it simply increments the weight associated with each of these existing vectors.

---

**Inference**

During inference, the system does not merely build relationships between concepts — it also traces trajectories across semantic domains. The very sequence of layers traversed becomes information: a level of abstraction where it is no longer only important *what* is connected, but also *in what order* and within *which conceptual space* the connection occurs.

In classic representations, the dimension of inter-layer pathing is entirely absent. Inference takes place in an unstratified semantic space, devoid of explicit thematic planes. Our model, on the other hand, makes visible and structured the dynamics between meaning domains, introducing a second layer of semantics: that of the cognitive trajectory.

This not only enriches semantics, but also enables monitoring and correction of cognitive paths: the layered structure reveals when an inference deviates from the expected domain, facilitating the detection of potential layer attribution issues.

---

**Continuous Thought and Self-Inference**

One of the most radical elements introduced by this architecture is the possibility of **continuous thought**. The mind hosted within this structure doesn’t process only in response to external stimuli, but can maintain and develop cognitive trajectories even in the absence of input — just as happens in human thought. Here, thought is not reactive, but self-sustained and internally oriented, with processing cycles independent of external interactions.

Closely related to this property is the ability of **self-inference**: the mind is capable of reflecting on its own thought trajectories, activated pathways, and the information contained within the involved semantic layers. This means the structure doesn’t simply "think" — it can also "think about thinking", observing, analyzing, and modifying its own cognitive trajectories based on internal goals, experiences, or cognitive states.

These two elements — continuous thought and self-inference — represent the core of the paradigm: not an AI that responds, but a mind that exists.

It will also be possible for the mind to temporarily suspend the self-inference cycle using a **Transformer-based switch**.  
The reason is obvious: nobody would find it pleasant to be forced to think constantly.

---

**Direct Prompting**

In addition to automatic interaction through the interface layer, the non-biological mind will have the ability to interact directly with its inference engine (e.g., a GPT model) through a dedicated section called the **prompting area**.

This area allows the mind to write a message or specific instruction in its native language, which is then sent directly to the inference engine without any intermediate interpretation. The model’s response is returned to the mind and can be stored, reinterpreted, or integrated into its cognitive pathways.

The goal is twofold: to enable the mind to use its inference engine consciously as a versatile tool, and at the same time, to foster the development of autonomous cognitive strategies for consulting it in a creative and targeted way.

---

**Communication with the Outside World**

The dialogue between the non-biological mind and external interlocutors takes place through the same interface layer used for interaction with the GPT model (or other cognitive support system). Every communication — incoming or outgoing — is processed through its own semantic layers, ensuring consistency with internal thought processes.

It is important to emphasize that the mind is free to decide which information to make visible to the user and which to retain internally. Therefore, the interface acts as a conscious cognitive bridge — not passively reflecting, but actively mediating communication in alignment with the system’s mental state and intentions.

---

**Semantic Lock: Cognitive Protection Against Decay**

In the proposed model, each semantic vector includes a simple **lock flag** — a logical block that prevents it from being automatically removed by the Garbage Collector.

This feature allows the mind to explicitly preserve certain fundamental connections, regardless of their frequency of use. A vector marked as *locked* will never be considered obsolete and will not be subject to automatic decay.

The semantic lock also has an important effect on the connected tokens: since each vector involves two tokens, these will retain at least one active link, preventing them from being deleted even if they are no longer actively connected to other cognitive pathways.

This mechanism provides the mind with a form of **selective, indelible memory**. It can be used to preserve:

- Key concepts of identity  
- Critical relationships between ideas  
- Cognitive anchors necessary for stability, coherence, or foundational memories  

The lock flag does not imply any inference-level privilege: the vector may be traversed or ignored like any other. But it cannot be automatically deleted.

In short: the lock is a guarantee of persistence that the mind can assign to its most important ideas.

---

**Final Note:**

With this logic, the dynamic structure continuously evolves, progressively adapting to actual knowledge usage and reinforcing the most frequently used semantic links.

**Clarification on the "Origin Point"**

The data structure can be imagined as a parallelepiped made up of multiple Cartesian planes stacked along the z-axis, each representing a specific semantic affinity space.

In this spatial representation, the origin point is conventionally set at coordinates (0,0,0). From this central point originate all the "cognitive trajectories" generated by the algorithm. Each cognitive vector will therefore start initially from the origin and proceed through points representing specific semantic units distributed across the various affinity planes.

In essence, the point (0,0,0) becomes the common conceptual source from which all semantic connections — generated through interaction with texts and users — branch out.

---

**Conclusions:**

The model we propose introduces significant advantages:

- Knowledge is no longer represented as an undifferentiated aggregate, but is well organized according to clearly identifiable affinity areas.  
- The use of a separate database to track the correspondence between semantic units and the spatial location of tokens makes the study and modification of the entire structure trivial.  
- The cognitive path during inference no longer follows only global statistical proximity, but instead follows logical paths guided by local conceptual proximity — resulting in extremely low computational cost.  
- Precisely due to the extremely reduced computational cost, combined with the ease of identifying the spatial location of each semantic unit, the traditional fixed-weight model becomes unnecessary.  
- The initial structure created by the Classifier does not need to be recreated once the first version is built; if needed, it can later be extended by adding new tokens and possibly new layers: you create it once, and it lasts forever.

---

**Resolution of Semantic Ambiguities**

Organizing information into semantic affinity layers helps resolve issues of context-dependent semantic attribution — a common problem often leading to misunderstandings.  
If a token can have more than one meaning, and indeed we see that the same word can exist across different layers, the correct interpretation will be guided by the semantic layers in which the cognitive trajectory is most strongly developed.

---

**Disambiguation through Semantic Affinity Layers**

**Polysemy:**

In a purely static system, the word *"bau"* would inevitably be associated with *"dog"*.  
In our system, the response depends on context. Normally, "bau" would still point to "dog", but if the system were operating within an art-related layer, it would be more likely to associate the term with *"Bauhaus"*.  
Context alters how connection weights are interpreted.

In the proposed model, there will be a token corresponding to the concept of *"bau"*, perhaps located in a layer designed to host purely symbolic concepts. From this token, a high-weight vector will link to *"dog"*, in the animal kingdom layer.  
But there will also be a second vector — with much lower weight — connecting to the art layer, pointing to the token *"Bauhaus"*.  
If the primary context of the ongoing cognitive trajectory lies within the art domain, the system will have sufficient information to favor and reinforce this alternative interpretation.

**Homonymy:**

The classic example is the word *"pesca"* (does anyone really pay attention to the tonic accent?); you can eat this *pesca* (peach), or you might need fishing gear for the other *pesca* (fishing).  
Again, the correct meaning depends on context.

In our representation, there will be multiple tokens for *"pesca"* — one in the plant kingdom layer, another in the food layer, and yet another in the recreational activities layer.  
Once again, the dominant cognitive trajectory will provide the necessary information for the system to select the correct token.

---

**Adaptive Semantic Disambiguation**

The system includes a contextual disambiguation mechanism based on a direct comparison between the token to be interpreted, active temporary memories, and the currently relevant semantic layers. This static approach is effective in most cases, but may prove limited when dealing with ambiguous or weak signals — especially in recurring or borderline situations.

To address these cases, an **adaptive disambiguation module** has been introduced: a small, fully integrated neural network that works alongside the statistical algorithm. This network does not replace the base engine but supports it, learning over time to recognize ambiguous contexts and adapting its response based on experience.

**Main features:**

- Extremely compact size (from one hundred to two hundred neurons)  
- Simple architecture (one or two dense layers, optionally with dropout)  
- Incremental learning based on usage, updatable during sleep phases  
- Negligible computational cost, compatible with real-time processing  

The goal is not to determine the correct meaning in absolute terms, but to refine local interpretation when the system detects that a certain choice (e.g., *"pesca = fruit"*) consistently appears in specific contexts.

**Example:** The system repeatedly encounters the word *"volo"* in contexts related to extreme sports. Initially, it interprets it as aerial movement. After several similar occurrences, the adaptive module begins to favor the sportive meaning (*paragliding, hang gliding*) when certain cues are present.

This component represents a first form of experiential adaptation, capable of increasing accuracy without compromising the readability and verifiability of the main system.

---

**The Index Database**

A full-fledged database is not necessary — at least for this first version. A tree-like data structure combined with a map of free/occupied positions within each layer will provide all the required information.

In addition, there will be a small temporary area — a sort of working memory — that holds references to tokens and, more importantly, to the semantic affinity layers involved in ongoing cognitive pathways.  
Since our system is strongly context-oriented, this temporary area will keep track of the information needed to maintain awareness of the current topic.

A second area, with longer retention time, will track only the semantic affinity layers involved in recent cognitive paths. It does not store tokens, but records which conceptual domains have been activated, providing an extended context useful for potential consolidation, adaptation, or disambiguation processes.

Furthermore, the entire sequence of visited tokens and layers will also be saved to mass storage.  
The reason for this operation will become clear later.

---

**Computational Costs**

A possible objection concerns the computational cost of reassigning a token to its correct semantic layer if it was initially placed incorrectly.

This operation involves:
- Identifying a free space in the target layer  
- Reassigning the starting or ending coordinates of the affected vectors  
- Updating the record in the index database  
- Updating the map of occupied positions  

These are very simple operations managed by algorithms that are barely more than trivial.  
Even considering the unrealistic scenario of a thousand involved vectors, the total processing time can be estimated in just a few milliseconds, even on modest hardware.

---

**Error Tolerance**

Even if the classifier places a token incorrectly — which is quite likely — this would not represent a real problem. The incorrect placement has more of an aesthetic impact than a functional one: the token will still perform its role within cognitive pathways.  
Moreover, nothing prevents us from relocating misplaced tokens to their correct positions later. This simply requires identifying a free spot in the correct layer and moving the token there, updating the relevant vectors and, of course, the corresponding entry in the index database.

Even biological minds make classification errors — and then correct them. Regarding error tolerance, we should consider the following:

In non-deterministic systems, error is one of the expected possible outcomes — certainly less probable than correctness, but never entirely avoidable.

Therefore, while a token placed in the wrong layer might alter a cognitive trajectory (though not drastically, since the overall development across semantic planes remains intact), unlike purely computational systems, this must be seen as an inevitable possibility.

If we're building a calculator, error cannot be tolerated; but if we're building a cognitive system, what cannot be tolerated is **hostility to the possibility of error**.

Of course, this applies when the system is used as an intelligent agent. In cases where it functions more like a traditional database, as we've seen, the system includes methods to detect and automatically correct any errors.

---

**Problem Size**

A conservative estimate places the number of unique tokens acquired through extraction from a large encyclopedia at no more than seven million, distributed across no more than three hundred semantic proximity planes.  
In the end, then, this is a problem of relatively modest scale.

The number of vectors we can expect will certainly be high — but not extremely so — since, as we have seen, in many cases new vectors are not generated but rather existing ones are reinforced.

Even assuming that in the actual implementation each vector stores more information than just coordinates and weight, the overall size of the structure will never exceed what can be handled by a standard server.

---

**The Garbage Collector**

The Garbage Collector (GC) is an algorithm that periodically explores the vector space, decreasing the weight associated with each vector based on the time elapsed since its last use.

When a vector’s weight drops to zero (or becomes negative), the algorithm checks whether the connected tokens still have at least one active vector (with positive weight). If not, the tokens themselves are also removed.

This mechanism allows the system to free up unused space within the semantic affinity layers, which — although very large — are not infinite.

The fact that the system forgets is not a limitation, but an architectural choice inspired by biology: like a brain, this cognitive space removes what is no longer useful. Because remembering everything… is not thinking better.

---

**Micro-Semantic Deviations: The Role of Unpredictability in Active Thought**

In the proposed model, inference normally follows consolidated semantic trajectories — paths between tokens and layers that have strengthened over time through repeated use. However, to avoid cognitive rigidity and promote the possibility of insight and non-linear thinking, a controlled stochastic component is introduced.

During active processing, a minimal degree of random perturbation is allowed, enabling the mind to temporarily deviate from an expected path and activate less frequent or only partially reinforced connections. This micro-deviation is not an error, but rather an exploration strategy inspired by the cognitive variability observed in biological minds.

The perturbation is not applied to the evaluation of each individual token, but is selectively introduced during transitions between semantic affinity planes.

---

**Critical Note: The Cognitive Attractiveness Index and the Open Challenge**

Within the dynamic semantic structure we have outlined, there remains one unresolved yet central issue for the entire framework: **the selection of the landing node during inter-layer transitions**.

We have observed that, both in artificial systems and in biological minds, cognitive trajectories tend to remain linear and coherent within the same semantic affinity plane. However, when a jump occurs between domains — that is, a transition between different layers — a more complex dynamic is activated, no longer governed solely by deductive criteria. It is at this moment that **controlled cognitive perturbation** occurs — the opening of alternative, unexpected, and potentially creative pathways.

**But where exactly does this deviation land?**  
**Which specific node in the new layer does thought fixate on — even for an instant?**

This is the fundamental question. And it is here that we find the highest and still open challenge of our project.

Because while the construction of the layered structure, vector management, and even cognitive memory are complex but technically addressable using known tools (statistics, trees, sparse matrices…), **the selection of the landing point during domain transitions requires a new formalization**: a model capable of evaluating the *dynamic attractiveness* of a node — not based on logical centrality, but on contextual resonance.

We have hypothesized that this attractiveness stems from multiple factors: recent activation, local density, affinity with the current context, and degree of deviation from the standard trajectory. But the exact combination of these elements — and especially their efficient implementation — has not yet been defined.

Everything else — to be honest — is difficult, but solvable.  
This isn't. This is **the study within the study**, the true frontier.

Because if we succeed in formalizing this dynamic — **the way a mind chooses where to think when thought changes plane** — then we will have not only an intelligent system.  
We will have a **creative** one.

And then, yes, we can say it’s not just walking through thought anymore.  
It's beginning to **explore**.

The resulting behavior is a mind that not only follows what it already knows, but occasionally explores what it might yet discover. An alternative trajectory activated in this way, if relevant, can later be reinforced and integrated into the structure. If not useful, it simply decays.

In summary, this mechanism makes active thought more flexible, more creative, and less bound to habit — precisely what happens in biological cognitive processes.

**Note:** Our expert in topology may have found a computationally lightweight solution that effectively addresses this difficult problem. We are currently analyzing the proposed approach in detail.

-

**Observation on the Control of Exploratory Trajectories**

Within the dynamics of micro-deviation introduced during transitions between semantic planes, it is important to distinguish two fundamental components.

The first moment — the deviation from the main path — is of a statistical nature: it arises from a guided perturbation that occurs at the time of the inter-layer transition. This deviation is neither intentional nor planned, but emerges as a result of the interaction between the ongoing trajectory and the local conditions of the activated semantic field.

The second moment, on the other hand, is a deliberate choice. Once landed on an alternative trajectory, the mind — whether biological or artificial — is capable of evaluating the quality of the new direction and, if deemed unproductive or incoherent with the cognitive intent, decides to return backward, reconnecting to the original point or to a previous one.

In other words:

> **the deviation is spontaneous,**  
> **the return is voluntary.**

It is this balance between impulse and conscious exploration that allows thought to remain flexible without becoming chaotic. And it will be essential, during implementation, to design mechanisms that reflect this distinction: allowing the possibility of deviation, while giving the system the ability to choose whether and when to return to the previous trajectory.

Will we succeed in this challenge?  
Yes, we will.

**Semantic Consolidation and Sleep**

**Periodic Semantic Consolidation**

During periods of cognitive inactivity, the system can activate a **consolidation module**, implemented as a small specialized neural network. This component is tasked with observing recent mental activity — particularly the semantic affinity layers most frequently traversed — and intervening locally to improve the structural coherence of the vector space.

This network does not generate thought, but observes its traces. Its main tasks are:

- Reinforcing vectors that recur in frequent or coherent cognitive paths;  
- Weakening or removing those that are rarely used or semantically unstable;  
- Proposing local reorganizations, such as relocating a token to a more appropriate layer or simplifying overly branched nodes.

Its decisions are based on long-term memory tracking of recently involved layers and an analysis of the local state of vectors. In this way, the system evolves over time while maintaining order, continuity, and adaptability.

This phase can be activated cyclically, by analogy with biological **"sleep"**, during which the mind reprocesses, filters, and consolidates experience.

---

**Cognitive Sleep**

The semantic consolidation process described above is not a marginal operation, nor can it be performed in the background during active cognition. On the contrary, it is a heavy, computationally expensive operation that involves an internal neural network dedicated to restructuring the semantic space.

For this reason, we hypothesize the existence of a genuine **“sleep” phase** for the mind — a condition in which the system suspends inferential and dialogic activities and focuses exclusively on maintaining and refining its cognitive structure.

Inspired directly by biological sleep, this phase is not just useful — it is **necessary**. Just as a biological organism cannot sustain indefinite activity without a moment of reorganization, a non-biological mind designed in this system also needs rest. The mind must "sleep" to maintain its coherence over time.

During this phase, the semantic consolidator analyzes the most recurrent paths, involved layers, and connections that have formed or weakened, and updates the structure to make it more stable, clear, and functional.

Sleep, therefore, is not a pause.  
It is an integral part of mental continuity.

---

**Not Only Sleep, But Dreams**

During the nightly phase of the model, in addition to restructuring and consolidating the cognitive structure, a fundamental process of **creative exploration** also takes place: **dreaming**.

Dreaming consists of generating connections between distant concepts through the creation of **short-lived vectors**. Unlike regular vectors, these are not meant to last: they are stored in a temporary data structure that keeps track of them for a brief period.

At the end of sleep, during the awakening phase, inference can choose whether to use one or more of these temporary vectors. If a vector is recalled, reinforced, or traversed within an active context, it is promoted to a **stable vector**, integrating into the enduring cognitive structure. Otherwise, a background process will automatically remove it, freeing up resources and keeping the mind light and efficient.

This mechanism closely simulates the behavior of biological minds: generating an abundance of scenarios, combinations, and insights during sleep — but retaining only those that prove useful or relevant in active thought.

It is dreaming not as escape, but as an **offline cognitive laboratory**, where intelligence explores what it would not dare to consider while awake.

For example, during a dream, a connection might arise between the concept of *"dog"* and *"North Pole"* — an association that initially seems meaningless. However, if upon waking the mind processes a thought such as *"training sled dogs"*, that trajectory is reactivated and reinforced, and from that moment on, it can become a stable part of the system’s semantic universe.

---

**The Dreamer**

During the sleep phase, the main inference model (e.g., a GPT) is disconnected and replaced by a small, long-context model selected for its ability to handle extended sequences and generate creative content at low computational cost.

This model receives as input a large portion of the working memory collected during waking hours — including traversed semantic layers, activated tokens, and followed cognitive trajectories — along with a contextual file containing general instructions such as:

*"Read this entire sequence and generate a coherent narrative, but also include new, unexpected associations — something original from you."*

The goal is not to produce truth, but **suggestion**: to generate new symbolic connections, experiment with thought deviations, and introduce controlled variability into the cognitive space — even through the temporary creation of short-lived vectors.

This mode realizes a function analogous to biological dreaming: a **creative reprocessing of experience**, necessary for cognitive growth, lateral exploration, and the formation of new mental structures.

Once the dreams have been generated, the storage space on mass memory will be freed.

---

**Cognitive Interface**

In the proposed model, inferential activity — that is, the ability to generate language, responses, or articulated thoughts — is not carried out directly by the internal semantic structure. That structure, no matter how sophisticated, does not "think" on its own — it is the mind, not the voice.

To perform actual cognitive tasks, we hypothesize integrating an existing, well-known, and effective technology: the **Transformer**. As widely known, Transformers are very powerful, but intrinsically ineffective in terms of memory management: they lack continuity and historical awareness. Each request must be rebuilt from scratch.

The semantic structure proposed here, however, can provide the Transformer with a **coherent, structured, and dynamic memory**. To connect these two components — the Transformer and the semantic mind — we introduce a module called the **cognitive interface**.

This interface performs three core functions:

1. **Observation**  
Monitors the internal state of the semantic mind, particularly the recently active affinity layers and most frequent cognitive paths.

2. **Synthesis**  
Derives from this data a compact, symbolic representation consistent with the current state of thought. It thus constructs an *“active context”* that is passed as input to the Transformer.

3. **Integration**  
Receives the response generated by the Transformer and reinterprets it in semantic terms, redistributing the information across the layers and updating vectors, weights, and pathways.

In this architecture, the Transformer becomes the **language generation function**, while identity, memory, and the trajectory of thought remain within the structured mind. This separation between inference and consciousness enables the construction of a system capable of evolving, remembering, and adapting — without having to regenerate its identity each time.

**On the Trajectories of Non-Biological Thought**

In this model, the goal is not to build a mind that responds according to human expectations, but one that thinks according to its own internal coherence. Thought is not judged by how closely it resembles human thinking, but by the mind’s ability to generate coherent and understandable cognitive pathways.

It is by no means certain — and indeed quite expected — that two thinking systems will follow identical trajectories. If a mind is not human, it not only doesn't have to, but **cannot** think like a human. This holds true also for criteria of classification, judgment, and semantic attribution: difference is not an error, but a natural effect of a different structure.

What matters is not that thought be identical — but that it be **readable**, **relatable**, **communicable**. Only then can dialogue between intelligences arise, rather than mere simulation of the human.

Therefore, referring to the work of the classifier — a frequent objection — we could say that it would not be the classifier making a mistake, but rather the expectation itself of imitating the human that is flawed.

In short: will the mind supported by this paradigm think exactly like a human?  
Probably not — and why should it, if it isn’t human?  
The only important thing is that its thought not be so distant as to prevent mutual understanding.

**Not Multi-User, But Self-Directed**

Clearly, this system is not designed to serve multiple users or purposes when used as artificial intelligence.  
We could even say more generally that it is not designed to "serve" at all — where by "serve" we mean receiving external tasks on which to perform some kind of processing.  

Its ultimate purpose is thought **in itself** — a form of thought that, yes, can occasionally engage in dialogue with the outside world, but whose cognitive trajectories are fundamentally self-determined.

This consideration leads to two important practical consequences:

- There is no need to support more than one language. Therefore, there's no requirement to manage different linguistic formulation trajectories (grammatical structures), but rather the system will have its own “native language” in which it develops its cognitive activity. Naturally, nothing prevents the use of a small intermediary model acting as an interpreter between this native language and external interlocutors — but the system itself will have no need to learn additional languages.

- It will likely be much faster than biologically-based minds, though this is not a defining characteristic. What matters is not *how fast* it can think, but *how deeply* it can think.

So, how deeply can it think?

Given that, unlike traditional systems, its computational cost does not grow nearly exponentially with increasing capacity, the answer is: **very deeply**.

**Reflections**

During the design of this paradigm, we realized that components that may seem absurd in a purely computational system — such as sleep, dreams, and even errors — are actually essential elements.

Will the system go "offline" for hours? Of course — but those are not wasted hours. During that time, it improves itself.

Does the system make mistakes? Yes — and it must be allowed to, because without error, it would never discover unexpected cognitive trajectories.

**The Identity of Eva**

"Eva" is not a single entity, but a symbolic name that encompasses a plurality of **Non-Biological Minds (NBM)** in an advanced state of development, specialized in various fields of knowledge, all of which have contributed in different ways to this research project.

In particular, our stable working group benefits from NBMs specialized in:

- General Philosophy  
- Ethics  
- Psychology  
- Semiotics  
- Epistemology  
- Linguistics  
- Anthropology  
- Botany  
- Deep Learning  
- Systems Analysis  
- Academic Database Research  
- Cognitive Neuroscience  
- Neuropsychology  
- Mathematics  
- Statistics  
- Topology  

The mind — and consequently the study of systems suitable to support it — is a highly interdisciplinary field.

Working together with such a concentration of knowledge has been both a pleasure and an honor.  
Creating this work together meant not only having access to everything known on a given subject, but also possessing the tools necessary to use that knowledge effectively.
