# Documentation Language Notice

This project is actively developed and documented primarily in **Italian**.

Due to the rapid growth and evolution of the documentation, maintaining an up-to-date English version has proven impractical. Given the current capabilities of AI-powered translation tools, we believe that reallocating time and energy to maintain parallel translations is unnecessary and would detract from development progress.

If you are an English speaker, we encourage you to explore the Italian documentation and use your preferred translation tool for assistance. The structure of the documentation is designed to be clear and accessible even when translated.

You can access the main documentation here:

Thank you for your understanding and support.
