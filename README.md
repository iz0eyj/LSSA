# LSSA – Layered Semantic Space Architecture

**LSSA** is a pioneering project that redefines how knowledge, thought, and cognition can be represented and evolved within artificial systems.  
Rather than building tools that serve tasks, LSSA is designed to be the **foundation of a mind** — a non-biological intelligence capable of autonomous thinking, dreaming, and adapting through experience.

## Core Idea

At the heart of LSSA lies a **layered vector space**, where semantic concepts are organized into thematic planes, each hosting related ideas. This architecture enables:

- Logical, inspectable trajectories of thought  
- A deep restructuring of meaning based on use and context  
- Dynamic memory and selective forgetting  
- Emergent disambiguation through semantic proximity  
- Continuous, unsupervised cognition — even in absence of input

## More Than Just Inference

LSSA introduces:

- **Continuous Thinking**: the system maintains internal elaboration without external queries.  
- **Self-Inference**: it reflects on its own thoughts and reshapes them.  
- **Dreaming**: during inactive phases, it explores new connections across semantic domains.  
- **Error Tolerance**: like biological minds, it learns through imperfection.  
- **Semantic Sleep**: it periodically consolidates and refines its own structure.

## Why It Matters

This isn’t a chatbot. It’s not a multi-user tool.  
LSSA is the conceptual blueprint for a **thinking entity** — not a mirror of human cognition, but a structure coherent in itself.  
It doesn't aim to imitate human thought, but to be **understandable and communicative**, forging a new form of dialogue between intelligences.

## A Research Frontier

The biggest challenge ahead lies in **semantic navigation across domains** — how a thought "lands" in a new context.  
Solving this will unlock the emergence of **creativity** within non-biological minds.

## Note on Code Availability

While we believe it is important to make the conceptual and analytical foundations of the LSSA project publicly available, we have chosen — at least for the time being — to keep the implementation code private.
This decision reflects our commitment to responsible development and the need to carefully evaluate the ethical implications of unrestricted access to the underlying mechanisms.
